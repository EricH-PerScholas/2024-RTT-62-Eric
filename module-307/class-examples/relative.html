<h1>Position Relative</h1>

<p>You guys can experiment with changing the position to relative or absolute
    to see how you can position the box.   The css properties to move the box are 
    left, right, top, and bottom.   I think about it as moving the box from the 
    top or from the left.
</p>

<p>The <strong>element</strong> is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then offset relative to itself based on
    the values of top, right, bottom, and left.
    <strong>The offset does not affect the position of any other elements;</strong> thus, the
    space given for the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.</p>
