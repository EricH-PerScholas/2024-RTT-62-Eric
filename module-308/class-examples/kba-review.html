        // using let once in the same code block, with var it will allow more than once

        // VERY COMMON GOTCHA - this is an every day important thing to know

        // all 5 of these are important to know for KBA

        // for example find all of the p tags

        // getElementsByClassName - finds all elements with the CSS class name

        // getElementsByName - finds all elements with name="" attribute

        // ***** Know for KBA
        // querySelector - find the first element in the document based on the CSS querySelector

        // 2 ways of registering an event listener
        // first is using the onclick="functionToRun()" on a html tag like we did in buttonclick.html
        // second using the addEventListner method built into the javascript language, this method is available on all HTML elements
        // to use the addEventListner function first you have to query the element from the document
        // then you can use the addEventLister('click', functionToRun());

        // ** If you want to spend some time reading about and experimenting with splice() and slice()
        // I have never in 20 years used either of these things
        // TRUE - Array.splice() changes the original array whereas Array.slice() does not.

        // 308.4 slide #28 talks about createing new HTML elements
        // there are 2 ways of creating elements
        // document.createElement('p');  this will create a new p tag in the document - can make all tags
        // createTextNode()  // this only works for text nodes like a p tag

        // Javascript tivia about numbers that is on the KBA
        // number datatype in javascript is either an integer or a float
