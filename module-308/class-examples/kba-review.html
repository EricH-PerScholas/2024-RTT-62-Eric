        // one difference between let and var is you can only define something
        // using let once in the same code block, with var it will allow more than once
        // using let is 
        let abc = "123";

        // VERY COMMON GOTCHA - this is an every day important thing to know
        let trick = 8 + "8";

        // all 5 of these are important to know for KBA
        // getElementsByTagName - find elements in the document by their HTML tag
        // for example find all of the p tags

        // getElementById - finds an element by the id="" attribute

        // getElementsByClassName - finds all elements with the CSS class name

        // getElementsByName - finds all elements with name="" attribute

        // ***** Know for KBA
        // querySelector - find the first element in the document based on the CSS querySelector

        // you can not subtract a string from a string
        // it is not causeing a compile or run error

        // 2 ways of registering an event listener
        // first is using the onclick="functionToRun()" on a html tag like we did in buttonclick.html
        // second using the addEventListner method built into the javascript language, this method is available on all HTML elements
        // to use the addEventListner function first you have to query the element from the document
        // then you can use the addEventLister('click', functionToRun());

        // ** If you want to spend some time reading about and experimenting with splice() and slice()
        // I have never in 20 years used either of these things
        // TRUE - Array.splice() changes the original array whereas Array.slice() does not.

        // 308.4 slide #28 talks about createing new HTML elements
        // there are 2 ways of creating elements
        // document.createElement('p');  this will create a new p tag in the document - can make all tags
        // createTextNode()  // this only works for text nodes like a p tag

        // Javascript tivia about numbers that is on the KBA
        // number datatype in javascript is either an integer or a float

        // ----------------- forEach loop -------------
        // note that I put an extra comma after the 5 to make a 6th element in the array that is acutally empty
        // the forEach method is called for each element in the array similar to a Java forEach but has differences
        // the nice part of this forEach is that you get the actual value, the index or pos, and the array itself
        // for each iteration of the loop.
        // index    0  1  2  3  4  5
        let arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ];
        arr.forEach( function(value, index, array) {
            console.log("value = " + value);
            console.log("index = " + index);
            
            array[index] = value * value;
            console.log("multiply = " + arr[index]);
        });

        // (Empty string) "", 0, false, null, undefined, and NaN are False Values
        // Javascript autoboxes 0 to false and 1 or greater is true
        // in the filter function using only a single variable in the function we are just getting the value in a
        // variable called x
        // the filer function is returning true or false, if it returns true then it will keep the element
        // if it returns false it will remove the element
        // however!!!!!   0 is another way of represeing false
        // SOOOOO when x % 5 == 0 it is essentially returning false
        console.log(arr.reverse().filter( function(x) {
            // when this evluates to 0 it causes javascript to consider it false which then
            // it does not alter the original array, it creates a new array and removes anything that evaluates to false
            return x % 5;
        }));
